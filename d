    Remove Wishlist and Compare
    
    This can be done via Journal template setting, but when turned off it
    also removes minimum purchase notification "Minimalus u≈æsakomas kiekis 3
    vnt., kas atitinka vienƒÖ pakuotƒô. Didesni kiekiai u≈æsakomi minimal≈≥
    kiekƒØ dauginant i≈° reikaling≈≥ pakuoƒçi≈≥ skaiƒçiaus. Pvz. jei min. kiekis 5
    vnt. u≈æsakoma arba 5, arba 10, arba 15 ir t.t. vnt."
    
    PROBABLY A BUG IN JOURNAL TEMPLATE
    
    if that bug is fixed in template this vqmod module is not needed
    
    It doesn't disable URLs to compare and wishlist whcih are
    route=product/compare and route=account/wishlist

    Flat or Free Shipment
    
    Flat or Free Shipment is a great replacement for your flat rate
    shipment.
    Now you can set up minimum order for free shipment within flat rate
    shipment module.
    
    If You already use separate flat rate and free shipment module then this
    module will solve your problem with flat rate and free shipment options
    displaying both at once at the checkout.
